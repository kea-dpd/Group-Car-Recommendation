This repo contains some issues which you can work as exercises. It will take you through som GitHub projects and -issues gymnastics.

You start by generating at new repo under your own profile (or where ever you wnat it), using this one as a template.

> [**_Code_ >> _Use this template_ >> _Create new repository_**](/../../generate)

There's a workflow that starts when you generate your repository - it copies the template issues over to your own repo - It may take 15-20 seconds to finish - You can monitor it in the __Actions__ tab.
